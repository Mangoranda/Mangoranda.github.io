<p align=left><h1> The Biosphere</h1>
<p align= left>As we all know the biosphere is made up of the parts of Earth where life exists. The<br> biosphere extends from the deepest root systems of trees, to the dark environment<br> of ocean trenches, to lush rainforests and high mountaintops. Scientists describe<br> Earth in terms of spheres. The solid surface layer of Earth is the lithosphere.
<p>The biosphere, also known as the ecosphere, is the worldwide sum of all ecosystems.<br> It can also be termed the zone of life on Earth. The biosphere is virtually a closed<br> system with regard to matter, with minimal inputs and outputs.
<p>What are 5 things in the biosphere?
The Biosphere: Life on Earth - How
Earth's <br>biosphere is the layer of the planet where life exists. That means you, me, plants,<br> insects, bacteria, and living things on land, air, and oceans make up the biosphere.<br> And in case you were wonderingâ€¦ viruses are part of the biosphere too.
<h2>Why is the Biosphere important? </h2>
<p>The biosphere provides the ecosystem that is needed for survival. Adaptation to <br>the biosphere's climate is expected for living organisms. Biodiversity thrives within<br> ecosystems, and the biosphere is a reliable source of food on Earth.
<h2>Why is it called a Biosphere? </h2>
<p>The term "biosphere" was coined by geologist Eduard Suess in 1875, which he<br> defined as the place on Earth's surface where life dwells.
