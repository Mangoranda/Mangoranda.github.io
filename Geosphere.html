<p align=left><h1> The Geosphere</h1>
<p align=left>As we all know the geosphere includes all the rocks that make up Earth, from<br> the partially melted rock under the crust, to ancient, towering mountains, to <br>grains of sand on a beach. Both the geosphere and hydrosphere provide the<br> habitat for the biosphere, a global ecosystem that encompasses all the living<br> things on Earth.
<p>The geosphere includes the rocks and minerals on Earth â€“ from the molten rock<br> and heavy metals in the deep interior of the planet to the sand on beaches and<br> peaks of mountains. The geosphere also includes the abiotic (non-living) parts <br>of soils and the skeletons of animals that may become fossilized over geologic<br> time.
<p>The geosphere has four subcomponents: lithosphere (solid Earth), atmosphere<br> (gaseous envelope), hydrosphere (liquid water), and cryosphere (frozen water)<br> (fig. 2). Each of these subcomponents can be further subdivided into elements:<br> for example, the oceans are an element of the hydro- sphere.
<h2>Why is it important? </h2>
<p>It starts at the ground and extends all the way down to Earth's core. We rely on<br> the geosphere to provide natural resources and a place to grow food. Volcanoes,<br> mountain ranges, and deserts are all part of the geosphere. Put simply, without<br> the geosphere, there would be no Earth!
