<p align=left>
<li>The total water on Earth is about 332.5 million cubic miles, or 1,386 million <br>cubic kilometres (km3).
<li>According to the proportion of water in the hydrosphere, there are the<br> following elements:
<li>Ocean – 97.6%
<li>Atmosphere – 0.0009%
<li>Saline lakes and Inland seas – 0.008%
<h2>Why is it called a Hydrosphere? </h2>
